# What's this app?

This is an internal web app to load data and show visualizations on citizen participation at [CÃ¢mara dos Deputados](http://www.camara.leg.br). As experiments evolve, reports and visualizations will be made available based on this code. At the moment, access to internal APIs and databases is required in order to load data.

# How do I run it?

This is all it takes
```
docker-compose up --build
```

# How do I load data?

Loading data from a database dump:
```
docker-compose up db
docker-compose exec -T db dropdb -U postgres camaraparticipacao
docker-compose exec -T db createdb -U postgres camaraparticipacao
docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres camaraparticipacao < dump.sql
```
